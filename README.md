# Association Rule Mining with A-Priori Algorithm
## Overview
This project implements the A-Priori algorithm for association rule mining in Python. The algorithm discovers frequent itemsets and generates association rules from market basket data, with configurable minimum support and confidence thresholds. The solution is optimized for performance and handles all specificed input/output requirements
